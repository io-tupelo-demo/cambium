= Clojure Cambium Demo

A simple demo on how to use the Cambium logging library in Clojure projects

=== Verify you have Java, Clojure, and Leiningen set up correctly

Try the following commands, and make sure you get similar output:

```bash
> java --version
java 13 2019-09-17
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 13+33)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 13+33, mixed mode, sharing)

> lein --version
Leiningen 2.9.1 on Java 13 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
```

== View the source code

```pre
> cat src/clj/demo/core.clj

(ns demo.core
  (:use tupelo.core)
  (:require
    [cambium.core :as log]
    [schema.core :as s])
  (:gen-class))

...<snip>...

(defn -main
  "I don't do a whole lot ... yet."
  [& args]
  (log/info "-main - enter")

  (println "Hello, World! Again!")

  (log/info "-main - leave"))

```

So we see that `cambium.core` is required into the namespace , then used to log a message 
upon entry and exit of the main program.  

== Running with Cambium log output

```pre
> lein clean ; lein run

15:24:57.003 [main] INFO  demo.core - -main - enter { ns=demo.core, line=17, column=3 }
Hello, World! Again!
15:24:57.004 [main] INFO  demo.core - -main - leave { ns=demo.core, line=21, column=3 }

```

So we can see the logging statements are executed and print canonical results, with the 
output of the `println` statement sandwiched inbetween.
